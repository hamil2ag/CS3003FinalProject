As a way of wrapping up our Programming Languages class, our professor tasked us with creating a program that explores concepts that were taught to us over the semester. 
MusicCatalogProgram.java explores the Object-Oriented paradigm in Java.
This program will prompt the user for a song, its genre, album, and personal rating.
Once the user is done cataloging their songs, a list will generate a table that sorts their information into a neat output.
